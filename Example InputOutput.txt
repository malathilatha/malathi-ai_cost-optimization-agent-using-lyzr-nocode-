Example Text (Input):
"I have around 1000 Hadoop projects, some of them have 10,000+ lines of logic. Can I use AI to convert them into BigQuery automatically? I also want to provide mapping for the table names. How long will it take and which model is best?"

### âœ… Automation Feasibility: Hadoop â†’ BigQuery

| Aspect               | Details                                                             |

| **Automation Possible**  | âœ… Yes â€“ highly automatable using AI with some manual QA         |
| **Best LLM Choice**      | Claude Opus (best reasoning) or Nova Pro (cost-efficient)       |
| **Estimated Cost**       | ~$0.05â€“$0.20 per project; ~$100 for 1000 projects               |
| **Timeline**             | ~6â€“8 days (2 days setup + 4â€“6 days batch run with reviews)      |
| **Confidence Score**     | ~88% overall (95% on schema, 85% on logic, 70% on UDF handling) |
| **Optimization Tips**    | Chunk large files, use prompt templates, cache reused code      |

#### ðŸ§  Additional Insight:
- You can automate dry-run validations using BigQuery APIs.
- For repeated logic patterns, a fine-tuned Claude Haiku model may reduce cost.

âœ… **Final Verdict:** Yes, you can automate this with high accuracy and cost-effectiveness using Claude or Nova Pro.
